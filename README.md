I'm a Graduate Student in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering and some experience in the corporate environment, my expertise lies in Web Application Development and Machine Learning. I'm currently exploring the research prospects around the Computational and Social Sciences.
I represented Hex Esports, Minus 40 Club and some other organizations in the PUBG MOBILE competitive scene as an academic esports player. I spend my leisure playing video games and cooking. Sometimes I like to travel and grab some memories in the form of photographs.
