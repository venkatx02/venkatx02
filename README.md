Iâ€™m a Graduate Student in the Data Analytics and Computational Social Science (DACSS) program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. With a strong foundation in computational science, Iâ€™ve applied my skills across diverse fields, including cybersecurity, political science, and philosophy. My unique strength lies in quickly grasping the essence of any domain and translating it into meaningful applications that are both technically rigorous and contextually grounded. My current research interests lie in political discourse, epistemology, and linguistics. I work with a wide range of computational methods, including machine learning, natural language processing, and large language models (LLMs), to craft data-driven narratives and uncover meaningful insights.

Outside of academics, I enjoy understanding philosophy and I admire critical art in all its forms. Cooking and video games are my stress busters. I also love to travel and capture memories through photography whenever I get the chance. In the past, I have represented organizations such as Hex Esports and Minus 40 Club in the PUBG MOBILE competitive scene as an academic esports player.
